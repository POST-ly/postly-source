# Basic Usage

# Requests

The starting page of POSTly is this:

A request is created automatically with "POST" as the default HTTP method.

If you want to send a GET request, click on the "POST" box, a dropdown will appear where you can select the HTTP method of the request you want to send.

I want to perform a GET request to my dev server so I choose "GET"

// pic

Now, type in the URL of the request in the "Enter request URL" box

// pic


I enter "localhost:500/api/teams"

So we send the request by clicking on the "Send" button on the right.

POSTLy then prints the result of the request in the "Pesponse" > "Body" tab below:
