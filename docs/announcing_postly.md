# Announcing POSTly

Neccesity they say is the mother of invention. So the quest to find a fast way to test my APIs neccesitated the invention of this tool, I call POSTly.

It all started when I was working on a project and I needed a fast way to test the API endpoints in the project so I can make sure they are all working fine. I used cURL but it became tedious, I have to write new test script for each API test. I have the Postman executable in my system in my system, I launched it but it was very slow to come up(tooks hours to launch escape pods), it was because of my low-powered system. Postman was very powerful and have used it before, so yeanred for something like Postman but in browser.

I  designed a web project in system for in-house, with no much of a nice UI. It did the job but with lesser options. Later on, I focused fully on it and it grew steadily and mid-way I termed it POSTly.
